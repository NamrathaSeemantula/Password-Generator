# Password-Generator
Developed a robust and user-friendly Password Generator application using Python that empowers users to tailor passwords based on both strength and desired length.

**Key Features:**

1. **Strength Selection:** Offers users the flexibility to choose from different password strength levels, including "Poor," "Average," and "Strong." Each strength level corresponds to a different set of password complexity criteria.

2. **Customizable Length:** Users can specify the exact length they want for their password.

3. **Randomized Passwords:** The core functionality of the application lies in its ability to generate truly random passwords that adhere to the selected strength and length criteria.

This provides a user-friendly and highly customizable solution for creating passwords. With options to select the strength and length of the password, users can confidently generate passwords that meet their specific security needs.
